This allows to use links e.g. [Basic CLI usage]({{ baseurl }}pmd_userdocs_installation.html) that work both
in the release notes on GitHub (as an absolute url) and on the rendered documentation page (as a relative url).

### üöÄ New and noteworthy

#### ‚ú® New Rules
* The new apex rule {% rule apex/codestyle/AnnotationsNamingConventions %} enforces that annotations
  are used consistently in PascalCase.  
  The rule is referenced in the quickstart.xml ruleset for Apex.
* The new java rule {% rule java/codestyle/TypeParameterNamingConventions %} replaces the now deprecated rule
  GenericsNaming. The new rule is configurable and checks for naming conventions of type parameters in
  generic types and methods. It can be configured via a regular expression.  
  By default, this rule uses the standard Java naming convention (single uppercase letter).  
  The rule is referenced in the quickstart.xml ruleset for Java.
* The new java rule {% rule java/errorprone/OverrideBothEqualsAndHashCodeOnComparable %} finds missing
  `hashCode()` and/or `equals()` methods on types that implement `Comparable`. This is important if
  instances of these classes are used in collections. Failing to do so can lead to unexpected behavior in sets
  which then do not conform to the `Set` interface. While the `Set` interface relies on
  `equals()` to determine object equality, sorted sets like `TreeSet` use
  `compareTo()` instead. The same issue can arise when such objects are used
  as keys in sorted maps.  
  This rule is very similar to {% rule java/errorprone/OverrideBothEqualsAndHashcode %} which has always been
  skipping `Comparable` and only reports if one of the two methods is missing. The new rule will also report,
  if both methods (hashCode and equals) are missing.  
  The rule is referenced in the quickstart.xml ruleset for Java.

#### Deprecated Rules
* The java rule {% rule java/codestyle/GenericsNaming %} has been deprecated for removal in favor
  of the new rule {% rule java/codestyle/TypeParameterNamingConventions %}.
